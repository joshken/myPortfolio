        <h1>Josh Kennelly</h1>
        <p>I am a designer and developer. Included in this portfolio are the projects I have worked on, both from school and work.</p>
        <p>I studied Software Engineering and Web Development at BYU-Idaho and worked for BYU-Idaho as a Web Developer and Graphic Designer as part of their Online Curriculum Development team.</p>
        <p>At work, I was responsible for creating graphic banners and course templates for the classes we were developing for online students.</p>
        <p>Our team would meet with the course instructors to identify the needs of their courses. When a concept was too difficult to understand without the guidance of the instructor, we would design infographics and interactive content to help the students learn these concepts.</p>

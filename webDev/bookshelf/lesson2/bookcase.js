The first pictures shows the boy sleeping in his room with a book on his chest, but from there, we see the boy&rsquo;s imagination take flight and we see his adventures.  (Interestingly, the border appears on the first set page, but during the dream sequence, the border appears on the left page only at the first of the dream, and reappears at the last of the dream on the right page before the end page.  In between the color goes clear to the edge of the pages.)  The twist happens at the end of the book when the boy wakes up and we see elements from his adventures appear in his room.  The question is whether or not the adventures were real or a dream.",

Longer than the typical 32-page picture books, Elephant (whose name is Gerald) and Piggie (whose name is Piggie) have a variety of adventures.  The language is relatively easy, and the ideas are fun and very much on the level of young readers.  For instance, some of the issues addressed in this series include sharing (or not), being ill or injured, playing tricks on friends, or even how hard it is to wait.  The illustrations are simple and consistently colored.  Gerald is always gray and Piggie is always pink.  Their words appear in thought bubbles and are usually colored the same color as the speaker.  I&rsquo;m amazed at how expressive the simple illustrations can be.  One of my favorite titles in this series is <i>We Are in A Book</i>, where Elephant and Piggie discover they are in a book.  They discover the joy of an audience, and watching what happens when they also discover the book ends makes me smile.

Now, however, we&rsquo;re going to discuss the best-known and most popular type of picture books: picture storybooks.</p><p>This is the kind of book most of us think of when we think of picture books.

Children understand these texts long before they could read them by themselves.</p><p>Because these kinds of picture storybooks can address wildly different ideas, there are many ways to break down picture storybooks.

				"description": "Caralyn Buehner and Mark Buehner combined to create <i>Snowmen at Night</i> which asks the question, &ldquo;what do snowmen do at night?&rdquo;  The pictures and the rhyming text show snowmen playing games, having ice-cold cocoa, and then coming home after a hectic night to stand in the yard the next day.  The pictures, done in oils and acrylics, show all kinds and sizes and even ages of snowmen engaged in amazing activities.  I&rsquo;m astonished at how expressive Buehner has made lumps of coal and white, round balls.  Mark Buehner has also hidden a cat, a dinosaur, a Santa Claus face, and a rabbit in almost every one of the pictures.  I&rsquo;ve looked and looked and he&rsquo;s hidden them well.",

				"description": "<i>The Velveteen Rabbit</i> written by Margery Williams is also about a personified object.  Children from all over love this story about a stuffed toy rabbit who seeks to know what it means to be &ldquo;real&rdquo; and questions the other toys in the nursery to find out what they know.  Told by the skin horse that it is painful, the stuffed toy rabbit isn&rsquo;t quite sure he wants that end.  However, when he becomes the favorite toy of the boy in the nursery, the stuffed toy rabbit discovers what it means to be &ldquo;real.&rdquo;  In the original version, this is quite a long story.  Some companies have shortened it and made it a board book, which, of necessity, shortens and changes the carefully nuanced story.  The other interesting thing about this particular story is that several different illustrators have done versions of this story.  William Nicholson was the original illustrator, but other illustrators, including Charles Santore, Monique Félix, Don Daily, and Michael Hague among others, have re-illustrated the book.  This book is also available through Project Gutenberg here <a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11757/11757-h/11757-h.htm'>http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11757/11757-h/11757-h.htm</a> Or also here <a href='http://www.archive.org/stream/velveteenrabbito00bian#page/n5/mode/2up'>http://www.archive.org/stream/velveteenrabbito00bian#page/n5/mode/2up</a>",

				"description": "A newer book that focuses on a personified object is a book entitled <i>I Stink!</i> by Kate McMullan and Jim McMullan.  In this book, a garbage truck from a big city talks about his day, which takes place at night while we are sleeping.  The garbage truck talks directly to the reader in a casual, almost abrupt way.  One favorite line points out that without the garbage truck and its compacting capabilities, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d be on Mount Trash-o-rama, baby.&rdquo;  As a bonus, there&rsquo;s a section on the garbage truck&rsquo;s alphabet soup with things like &ldquo;nasty neckties&rdquo; and &ldquo;zipped up ziti with zucchini.&rdquo; The pictures highlight the actions of the garbage truck, and many of the sounds are written in bigger letters or font.  The text changes size, color and font and almost invites the reader to use voices.  This same duo of Kate McMullan and Jim McMullan have done other books using this same premise, such as <i>I&rsquo;m Dirty, I&rsquo;m Mighty, I&rsquo;m Fast</i>, etc.  These are great books for boys.",

				"description": "<i>A Bad Case of Stripes</i> written and illustrated by David Shannon is a great book to illustrate this particular category.  In it, Camilla Cream is influenced so much by peer pressure that she becomes whatever anyone says to her.  When she is prescribed a pill, she turns into a giant capsule, complete with small, round, multi-colored insides.  I especially like the picture where an environmental therapist tells her to become &ldquo;one with the room.&rdquo;  Camilla then becomes her room, with the dresser as her nose, two pictures serve as her eyes, and her bed becomes her mouth.  This &ldquo;bad case of stripes&rdquo; continues until she learns to stand up for what she likes and learns to not care about what others think.  The wild adventure is part of the fun, and it is interesting to see how many different things Camilla can become.",

				"description": "<i>Stand Tall, Molly Lou Melon</i> written by Patty Lovell and illustrated by David Catrow has a great message, but the exaggeration places it in the fantasy section.  Molly Lou Melon is a very tiny girl who has a wonderful grandmother who encourages her to change her weaknesses into strengths.  The comparisons (she has a voice like a bullfrog) and the pictures (one of which is two page spread of an up-close smile) combine to move this book into the fantasy category.  How Molly Lou Melon stands up for herself in her new school when she meets the school bully is a great lesson for children.  David Catrow&rsquo;s illustrations are detailed, especially his faces, and focus on Molly Lou Melon.  I especially like the sense of joy that Molly Lou Melon exudes as most of the lines and movement in the book combine to &ldquo;lift&rdquo; the readers&rsquo; attention upward.",

				"description": "Another fun book that would fall into this category is <i>How I Became a Pirate</i> by Melinda Long with illustrations by David Shannon.  A small boy is at the beach when passing pirates decide he&rsquo;s a good digger based on his sand castle.  His parents don&rsquo;t seem to mind when he goes off with the pirates, but he soon discovers that pirating isn&rsquo;t as fun as he originally thought.  Melinda Long&rsquo;s text expresses the wish of every small boy to be a pirate, and, combined with David Shannon&rsquo;s illustrations, makes this a fun book for both adults and children.  Shannon&rsquo;s illustrations are a little more detailed than his usual illustrations, and the visual twists Shannon provides to the story are quite wonderful.  For instance, watch the pirate who wears a patch on both eyes.  The visual twist at the end is also a nice kind of joke for children (and the adults who read them the book).",

The rhyming text is matched to a bug-eyed little boy, complete with a look of terror on his face.  Arnold&rsquo;s people tend to look a little blocky, and their eyes are always spheres that don&rsquo;t quite match.  I enjoy the illustrations because the readers see not only what really is happening, but we are also treated to illustrations that demonstrate what the young narrator thinks is happening.  In every illustration, there is a toy tank, a toy superhero, and a toy dinosaur.",

				"description": "Tony Fucile has used an almost retro style of illustrations in his book <i>Let&rsquo;s Do Nothing</i>.  An animator by profession, Fucile has used ink, colored pencil and acrylics to capture two small boys who have done &ldquo;everything.&rdquo;  So, of course, they try to do &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; for 10 seconds.  They pretend to be statues in the park, only for Frankie to imagine shooing the pigeons who come to sit on him.  Pretending to be trees in the forest is disrupted when Frankie imagines a visit by the dog.  Even pretending to be the Empire State Building isn&rsquo;t successful because King Kong has to climb Frankie&rsquo;s version of the Empire State Building.  The pictures show how hard Frankie is trying to pretend, and Fucile&rsquo;s style includes showing the &ldquo;tree&rdquo; Frankie with the glasses the real Frankie wears.  I love the way the children pretend and discover, just as we all do, that it&rsquo;s not possible to do &ldquo;nothing,&rdquo; especially when you&rsquo;re a kid.",

One Thursday morning, Imogene wakes up to find she has grown antlers.  These aren&rsquo;t small antlers, but instead are both tall and wide.  Imogene acts like nothing is unusual, even though she has some difficulties getting dressed and going through doors.  The people in her life have various reactions:  her mother keeps fainting, the cook gives her donuts and then puts other donuts on her antlers and sends her out to feed the birds, the principal glares at her, and the maid uses her antlers to dry dishtowels.  On Friday, Imogene does lose her antlers, only to gain something else.  The watercolor illustrations are both bright and focused.  The details in the pictures only add to the fun.  Imogene&rsquo;s calm response to her sudden change in circumstances is also a lot of fun, and the pictures help add details to the text.",

				"description": "<i>My Lucky Day</i> written and illustrated by Keiko Kasza tells the story of hungry fox, who is just thinking about hunting for dinner when a piglet knocks on his door, mistakenly looking for Rabbit.  While the fox thinks it&rsquo;s his lucky day that a pig roast has shown up at his door, the piglet points out that he&rsquo;s dirty, skinny, and probably tough.  The fox gets right to work; he cleans, feeds, and massages his pig roast.  Of course, as is often the case, the piglet has a plan&mdash;and his plan doesn&rsquo;t include being eaten for dinner.  Kasza&rsquo;s watercolor illustrations of both Mr. Fox and the piglet are incredibly expressive. Each action is highlighted, sometimes in separate pictures scattered on a page and sometimes with a full-page picture.  One of my favorite ways the pictures and the text work together in this text is that the twist at the very end of the book isn&rsquo;t explained, we&rsquo;re only given a picture of the list of the piglet&rsquo;s future planned visits.",

				"description": "In <i>How Do Dinosaurs Say Good Night?</i>  written by Jane Yolen and Mark Teague, dinosaur &ldquo;children&rdquo; demonstrate both how to say and not say goodnight.  Yolen&rsquo;s rhyming text first asks questions about bad behavior such as &ldquo;Does a dinosaur slam his tale and pout,&rdquo; and then about halfway through the book, the text switches to reinforcing positive behavior, with answers such as &ldquo;No, dinosaurs don&rsquo;t.  They don&rsquo;t even try.  They give a big kiss.&rdquo;  What makes this humorous and fantastical is that the dinosaur &ldquo;children&rdquo; have human parents.  Mark Teague, the illustrator, has drawn the dinosaurs somewhat to scale; for instance, they&rsquo;re always much larger than their human parents, and they&rsquo;re drawn in an accurate representation.  The acrylic illustrations focus on the features of each dinosaur, and I appreciate the fact that the illustrations always feature the correct name of the dinosaur somewhere in the picture of the &ldquo;child&rsquo;s&rdquo; room.  Teague has also made interesting choices about which dinosaurs illustrate which specific behaviors.  This book is the first in a series of books asking the question &ldquo;how do dinosaurs do&rdquo; everything from getting well soon to going to school.",

Wilson&rsquo;s rhyming text with great descriptive words introduces us to the great brown bear who is sleeping through the winter cuddled up in his lair.  One by one, smaller animals and birds seek to share Bear&rsquo;s shelter.  Mouse starts a fire, and the other birds and animals each bring food to share.  They eat, talk, and still &ldquo;The bear snores on.&rdquo;  A stray speck of pepper, however, causes a great sneeze and the bear awakens.  And then the twist happens.  When the bear awakens, he&rsquo;s not happy and, for just a moment, the reader is afraid for the other animals.  But Bear&rsquo;s only upset because the other animals have had fun without him.  However, Mouse points out that they can make more food and have more fun.  And they do, but afterwards, now Bear is the one who can&rsquo;t sleep.  The pictures, done in acrylics by Jane Chapman, show each of the animals and birds mentioned, and show them in relative scale to one another and the bear.  The nicely detailed pictures are warm, and show great attention to the facial expressions of all the animals.",

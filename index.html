        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>I am a designer and developer from Sugar City, Idaho. I studied Software Engineering and Web Development at BYU-Idaho and worked for BYU-Idaho as a Web Developer and Graphic Designer as part of their Online Curriculum Development team.</p>
        <p>At work, I was responsible for creating graphic banners and course templates for the classes we were developing for online students.</p>
        <p>Our team would meet with the course instructors to identify the needs of their courses. When a concept was too difficult to understand without the guidance of the instructor, we would design infographics and interactive content to help the students learn these concepts.</p>
        <h3>Now</h3>
        <p>I'm currently working as a Property Manager in the Seattle area. I continue to use my skills in Web Development and Graphic Design to better the company I work for. I have helped redesign their brand and have created tools online to improve their efficiency.</p>
        <p>I'm hoping to find a job where I can continue to grow and improve my knowledge of Web Development.</p>

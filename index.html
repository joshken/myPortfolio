        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>I am a designer and developer from Sugar City, Idaho. I studied Software Engineering and Web Development at BYU-Idaho. They hired me as a Web Developer and Graphic Designer for Online Curriculum Development.</p>
        <p>At work, I was responsible for creating graphic banners and course templates for our online courses.</p>
        <p>A team of us would meet regularly with the instructors to identify the needs of each course. Occasionally, we were asked to design infographics and interactive activities to help online students understand difficult concepts.</p>
        <h3>Now</h3>
        <p>I'm currently working as a Property Manager in the Seattle area. I continue to use my skills in Web Development and Graphic Design to better my company. I have helped redesign their logo and set up tenant information in our new software, Yardi Voyager. I am currently designing custom tools including an online Vacancy Report and Legal Document Tracking system.</p>
        <p>I want to find a job where I can continue to grow and improve my knowledge of Web Development.</p>

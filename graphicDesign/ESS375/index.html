			<h3>About the Banner</h3>
			<p>The banner for this course was created by a coworker.</p>
			
			<h3>About the Template</h3>
			<p>I continually developed and changed the structure of this template throughout my time working at BYU-Idaho. It was coded specifically to work with our Learning Management System (LMS) at the time, which was Brainhoney.</p>
			<p>I had to find a lot of work-arounds in order to override Brainhoney's default styling. After I had resolved all of the styling issues, this template pattern became the standard for every course developed in Brainhoney.</p>
			
			<h3>Template Extras</h3>
			<p>The instructor for this course requested an additional banner that would identify the module and lesson. I created an HTML banner that could be changed for each page.</p>
            <p>I also created a <a href="schedule.html" target="_blank">custom schedule</a> for this course.</p>

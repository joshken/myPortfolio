			<h3>About the Banner</h3>
			<p>The banner for this course was created by a coworker.</p>
			
			<h3>About the Template</h3>
			<p>This template is slightly different from the one I developed for Brainhoney. It was adapted and customized for a newer LMS, Desire2Learn (D2L). BYU-Idaho started converting their courses to D2L a few months before I left.</p>
			<p>In this template, I cleaned up the code and orginized the structure a little more. I added a dynamic footer for copyright along with other dynamic content, such as accordion lists and drop down menus. This allowed instructors more flexibility in designing their courses.</p>

			<h3>About the Banner</h3>
			<p>I designed the banner for this course. I chose images that most closely related to the units of this course.</p>
			
			<h3>About the Template</h3>
			<p>I continually developed and changed the structure of this template throughout my time working at BYU-Idaho. It was coded specifically to work with our Learning Management System (LMS) at the time, which was Brainhoney.</p>
			<p>I had to find a lot of work-arounds in order to override Brainhoney's default styling. After I had resolved all of the styling issues, this template pattern became the standard for every course developed in Brainhoney.</p>
